# Knossos
Is a webapp for manipulating and generating text using Markov chains

## Inspiration

Inspired by the Jorge Luis Borges' story _The Garden of Forking Paths_, Knossos aims to allow the user to create their own textual labyrinths through rudimentary text generation techniques and esoteric web design. The name knossos derives from the Cretan island that is the legendary home of King Minos and his labyrinth. 

## Structure

The webapp is broken into two screens, one for inputting base text and the other for new text generation. Ideally these would be in the same page but since part of this initial project is meant to showcase multiple page webapps for a pairing interview the multi-page structure is a good place to start. 

# TODOs
- [ ] be able to input arbitrary number of texts
- [ ] add history to each input so you can go back after you change an input
- [ ] be able to adjust weight of each input

# For Development:

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
