Inspired by the Jorge Luis Borges' story _The Garden of Forking Paths_, Knossos aims to allow the user to create their own textual labyrinths through rudimentary text generation techniques and esoteric web design. The name knossos derives from the Cretan island that is the legendary home of King Minos and his labyrinth.
